-Notebook name is Untitled (yes, this was on purpose). 
-Data: green_spaces.csv https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/operations-green-spaces/resource/5cf7163b-f76c-47ef-b48d-a16366ac1835?inner_span=True 

This data examines all the different green spaces that are provided here in Pittsburgh and compares what each green space in each neighborhood has to offer. So in a way, I'm already working with "good neighborhoods" simply because they have green spaces to offer. So I wanted to see which green spaces are better than the rest. By doing this I look into data that is covering the total space/acreage of the greenspace, population, and representation.  I found that this connects to our metric by searching for the best parks and recreational spaces, by attempting to find a green space that accommodates its people based on its acreage.

-Notebook name is Courts
-Data: Ccourts.csv https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-courts/resource/a5b71bfa-840c-4c86-8f43-07a9ae854227

This dataset shows the number of courts and other recreational areas as shown in each neighborhood in Pittsburgh. It connects to our metric of neighborhood with the most number of parks and recreational spaces because the more courts/rinks, the more recreational facilties there are. The higher amount of courts and rinks, the more recreational spaces there are.

-Notebook name is Tree Counts
-Data: trees.csv https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees/resource/1515a93c-73e3-4425-9b35-1cd11b2196da\

This dataset shows the amount of trees in each neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Trees are often found in parks and greenspaces and they also are used for leisure. The more trees that a neighborhood has, the nicer the neighborhood because it feels less city-like and offers a more pleasing expireinece.
