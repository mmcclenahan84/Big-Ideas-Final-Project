# Big-Ideas-Final-Project
Our project determines which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the best to live in based on how green the neighborhood is.
How "green" a neighborhood is is determined by the amount of trees, the average AQI (air quality index), and if the neighborhood has a greenspace or not.
All of these factors are taken into account and graded based on the factors mentioned above.
